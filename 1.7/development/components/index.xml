      <description>Global JavaScript components? It&amp;rsquo;s a new system available since the 1.7.8 version mainly created for module developers, which allow you to use components we already use in the core without importing it. Here is the ADR where we decided what we should do to avoid this problem.
You are now able to use components we expose to the window.prestashop.component object without importing anything.
This object contains two attributes:
 component which contain some components you can instantiate; instance which contains every instances of initiated components.</description>

      <title>The Faceted Search component</title>

      <description>The Faceted Search Architecture This document describes the faceted search architecture that is being implemented in PrestaShop 1.7.
Please also read the extensive comments in classes/controller/ProductListingFrontControllerCore, as this document is only a high-level explanation.
The target audience is anybody who wants to develop a well-integrated search module that replaces the way the PrestaShop core searches for products.
At the moment this proof of concept works only on the CategoryController but it is easy to extend to the other product controllers (manufacturers, supplier&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <title>TinyMCE</title>
      <link>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/components/tinymce/</link>

      <description>Modify the TinyMCE configuration You are able to modify the configuration by using the actionAdminControllerSetMedia hook.
Inside the JS file you added with this hook, you need to create a global object containing your custom configuration:
window.defaultTinyMceConfig = { [...] } and as you can see in the tinymce core file it will load it instead of the default core configuration.
Keep in mind that the config is not completely replaced, it&amp;rsquo;s an Object.</description>
